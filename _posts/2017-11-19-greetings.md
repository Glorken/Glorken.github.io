Hey, so I've made a blog! I don't have much to put on it, so I guess that it'll be more of a personal journal that people might eventually see. It's more of a venture into writing constantly than actually having something specific to share.

So, I ought to tell a bit about myself here, right? Well, I have been going by the name Glorken, and I guess that I'll be using that name for a while. I enjoy programming, electronics, and mathematics, and I like to go to robotics competitions. I also absolutely love linguistics, and I am fascinated by the diverse languages that humans have created.

I enjoy fantasy and science-fiction, especially when the creators go deep into the lore and world-building. However, I love a good amount of humor in any story. Among my favorite authors are J.R.R. Tolkien, Robert Heinlein, H.G. Wells, George Orwell, Douglas Adams, George R.R. Martin, and Terry Pratchett.

I have been trying to write more, both to improve my ability to illustrate my ideas and to become better at creating stories. Great thinkers-- be they philosophers, scientists, engineers, or artists-- have creativity at their cores, and I want to be able to realize my potential. this blog should help me out in this aspect, allowing me to write my thoughts on anything and post them here.

If you are actually reading this, then either I did something extraordinarily stupid or you're a stalker. I'm not sure which is worse, to be honest. Whichever the case may be, feel free to contact me at <contact@glorken.me>. I'll hopefully have that working by the time I get my first reader.

Until later, I'm signing off. See you then!
